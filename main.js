The email is not helpful and is supposed to be deleted after 30/60 days.\n" +
    "  - `Notices/OTP`: This is a subcategory of `Notices`. Especially to verify my email address, containing several digital numbers or combined with short strings. It's time-sensitive. The email is not helpful and should be deleted after I proceed with it.\n" +
    "  - `Notices/Status`: This is a subcategory of `Notices`. Especially to inform me of the status of an online order, shipment and parcel tracking, an App in Google Play / App Store, or a website.\n" +
    "  - `Feeds`: This is an informational email worth reading, maybe my subscription, such as news, school newsletters, e-magazines, articles, and weekly/monthly reports (except computer-generated ones), not including marketing emails for promotion.\n" +
    "  - `Promotions`: This email is a marketing message that may be promotional, bulk, or commercial. It is possible that this email could be classified as spam.\n" +
    "  - `Others`: Any other email you cannot put into the categories above.\n" +
